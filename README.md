# Texter
A program to text messages or file contents to cell phones. Use Texter to send individual messages. It can also 
be used to check files for changes and send the file contents as a text. It does this by checking the archive bit 
on a file. If the archive bit is set then the contents have changed and the text is sent. After the text is sent 
the archive bit is cleared, ready for the next message. Use 'Choose File' to select the file you want to monitor.
  On the Setup form enter your cell phone number and your cell phone provider's sms address (ex: sms.phoneco.com). 
Enter the info for your SMTP Server (ex: SMPTP2GO).
